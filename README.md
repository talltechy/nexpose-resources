# Nexpose Resources

A collection of scripts, reports, SQL queries, and other resources for use with Nexpose and InsightVM. The goal of this repository is to make it easy to find, use, and contribute to up-to-date resources that improve productivity with Nexpose and InsightVM.

## Types of Resources

## Scripts

Utility scripts typically built for a specific purpose. Each script may be available in multiple programming languages.

You will primarily find scripts compatible with [nexpose-client](https://github.com/rapid7/nexpose-client) (Ruby) and [nexpose-client-python](https://github.com/rapid7/nexpose-client-python) (Python) in this repository.

## SQL Queries

Ready to use queries for the SQL Query Export and/or Data Warehouse features for creating custom reports.

SQL query examples from the old community site have moved to the new knowledge base: <https://kb.help.rapid7.com/docs/sql-query-export>
